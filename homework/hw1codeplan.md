* message telling user result

First, I need the user to tell me their weight. I'll use a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. When the user clicks the button, I'll activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I'll grab the user input, multiply it by the conversion factor of 44.3 and divide it by 100. This will give the number of 12oz American coffees the person can consume before they die. Then I'll return a message telling this number.
