Stranger Things Wall

This program is a message generator where the user enters a message they want to send and the message will appear/ start blinking on the "stranger things wall" 

* inputs
* save messaage
* output
* the message will blink on the wall 

First, the user needs to input the message they would like to appear. For this I will use a form text input. The user will have to click on a button to submit their answer. When the user clicks the button, it will send the message (sendMessage function). In my function, I need to set a counter so that it loops through each character in the string. I'll match each letter to one of the light bulbs (interface item) on the light wall. Then the user's message will flash on the wall.
